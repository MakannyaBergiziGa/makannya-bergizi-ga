# MBG Photo Gallery

this README will be written in *mostly* english. because i find it much easier to write in. Anyways, this README contains the author's thoughts and also some fun data about MBG. before i start, do look out for grammar inconsistencies.

to start off, im sure some people who followed the author has been wondering which school these MBG are based on. i will now reveal which school these MBG photos are from. it's from MAN Surabaya. no other locational information will be provided.

### My thoughts on MBG

when i first heard of wowo's MBG plan, i instantly disagreed. cause i thought the money that'd be spent on MBG could be allocated somewhere else. and they definitely didnt cut the budget on of other sectors of the government in favor of MBG (though this is based on what i remember. i might be remembering things wrong). but since most of my friends and fellow students seems to be in favor of MBG, then sure. see what happens.

and whaddayaknow, some schools completely struggle to maintain quality in their MBG menus. some even poisoning students. im sure those problems are solved by now, but it was still quite disastrous. when MBG finally arrived to my school, it came late... but the food... was alright. it was 'good enough' for me. very good for others. and somehow, throughout this entire semester, no one has been poisoned. signifying that MBG at my school are being taken care of very well.

im still under the opinion that MBG is an unecessary spending for tax money. but oh well. what power do i have at this age. this ends my thoughts on MBG.

# Some fun and perhaps interesting data from a survey.
at the end of the semester, a few days before libur panjang, i made a short survey and managed to ask a total of 23 students at school into answering it. in hindsight, the survey was quite rushed. and i didnt include a wide enough answer choice for certain questions. but i hope that these datas help give you the general perception on MBG.
